/* Why it's global:
	1. Debug drawing is performed in many places in the logic, even in some very modular ones (force application). 
	If we stored it somehow in logic_step, we would need to pass step information to these modular functionalities as well,
	so that they may access the settings.
	This would be unnecessary headache.

	2. Access to a global variable is faster which is important in the logic,
	especially given that we might not want to use the debug drawing at all.

	3. We 'could' store it in augs::renderer, to which anyway global access is possible,
	but then we couple very game-specific flags with a structure that is just meant to be pushed triangles and lines into.
	Anyway, augs::renderer does not use that information at all.

	4. We couldn't care less.
