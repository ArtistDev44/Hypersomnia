*Hypersomnia* is a competitive arena released as free & open-source software :heart:.
It is written in modern C++, **without a game engine!**.

This project aims to be **the ultimate open-source 2D shooter** - a grand community project* extensible without limit.

*Comes with an [in-game map Editor!](https://hypersomnia.io/editor/official)*

## Introduction

Hypersomnia has been online and playable since 2017. It brings together:

- the tactics of *Counter-Strike*,
- the dynamics of *Hotline Miami*,
- the pixel art nostalgia of oldschool RPGs,
- and the potential for endless creativity thanks to an in-game map editor!

**Today, it contains :**

- an **interactive tutorial** for news players
- **[24 unique firearms!](https://hypersomnia.xyz/weapons)**
  - And an extra 4 grenade types, 7 melee weapons as well as 6 magic spells!
- **[10 community maps](https://hypersomnia.xyz/arenas)** and counting!
- An **in-game map editor** 
	- that lets you host a **work-in-progress map** to *instantly* play it with your friends, **even behind a router** after your friends downloaded your map and this ressources.
    *(like in CS 1.6)*

## Background

*Hypersomnia* has been in development **since 2013**.

It didn't take 10 years of uninterrupted coding, though - in the meantime, I worked commercially to cover my costs of living. I saved money to be able to work less and focus on *Hypersomnia*. My financial decisions now let me develop the game full-time.

I use a lot of 3rdparty libraries like ``Box2D`` (physics) or ``yojimbo`` (transport layer) - [everything not on this list,](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia/tree/master/src/3rdparty) however, is written pretty much from scratch, in pure C++.

Many believe that writing games without an engine is no more than *reinventing the wheel*, or put more bluntly, a complete waste of time.

**I hope this project serves as a great testament to the opposite.**

Had I never embarked on this journey, I would have never made some of the interesting discoveries detailed in [Tech highlights section.](###tech-highlights)
Video game internals are just so vast and interdisciplinary that they have limitless potential for creative breakthroughs, and it is a waste to never even entertain the idea that some widely used solutions can be replaced by something absolutely ingenious.

## Tech highlights

<sub> <a href="github.io"> long version </a>

- **[rectpack2D,](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D) written for packing textures, became famous and was used in [Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KnjDL4DnwM&t=2382s)**

- Networking based on **cross-platform simulation determinism**. It is 100% deterministic **even across browser** ***and*** **native clients** (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and that includes **native ARM builds (aarch64)!**
-
	- Only the player inputs are transmitted
    - Even the silliest details like bullet shells are fully synchronized *without* paying for it with network traffic.

  - The lag is hidden exceptionally well as the game doesn't just mindlessly "extrapolate" frames visually - rather, it simulates the entire game world forward *offscreen* to accurately predict the future.

- Memory pool [implementation](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia/blob/master/src/augs/misc/pool/pool.h) with:
  - **Contiguous storage**.
    - All game objects in existence are kept **linearly in memory**
      - It means blazing-fast iteration of all game objects of the same type, as well as trivial pool serialization.

### Accounts

- In the browser version, you can **sign in with Discord** and play ranked matches to compete on the [global Leaderboards](https://hypersomnia.xyz/leaderboards)!
-
  - You can also [associate your Discord with Steam](https://hypersomnia.xyz/profile) **sharing the same rating!**

- **Discord** and **Telegram** notifications when:
  - a new game version is deployed
  - a 1v1 "duel of honor" begins (auto-detected whenever there's only 1 player per faction),
  - community server hosted
  - full player stats and the MVP at the end of a game

### Hosting

- You can host a working game server *from the main menu* - the game is able to **forward ports out of the box!**
  - Fish and insects react to shots and explosions!
    - And once they're scared, they keep closer to members of the same species.
- Anyone can host **[the entire *Hypersomnia* server infrastructure.](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia-admin-shell)**
 are [digita
  - The Editor, the game server *and* the masterserver (server list keeper) are **all embedded in the same game executable**, on every OS.
  - You could run a separate server list for your own community around a completely modded version of *Hypersomnia*!

  - **Perfectly undoable allocations and frees.**

### Editor & Playtesting

  - created with the excellent [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
	  - working *directly* on the game world. 100% WYSIWYG.
 	 - Supports custom resources. It's enough to paste folders with PNGs, WAVs, OGGs to the map directory..
      - ..alt-tab back to the game and it will automatically pick it up
      - Supports GIFs as well! Just drag&drop them on the scene and they will be animated in-game, right out of the box!
  - It's possible to playtest a *work-in-progress map* with **a single click**:
    - You can publish your map directly as the host
	    - The connecting clients will automatically download the map in its current version with all its custom resources.
      - And they can later **create their own remake** - maps are saved in JSON, after all!
    - ESC will let you stop the session and go back to the Editor **exactly as you left it**, enabling ultra-efficient iteration cycles.
    - This is possible because the server, the game and the editor are **all within the same executable.**
    - The official Discord will also be notified that you're playtesting a map, so others can join in on the fun!
