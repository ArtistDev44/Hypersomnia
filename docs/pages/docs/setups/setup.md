summary: |
    **Setups** are the most abstract chunks of functionality,  
    e.g. a server, a client, an editor or a local test scene.  

    Usually, each *setup* has a single dedicated button in the game's main menu.  
    Users may choose which setup to launch on startup via a relevant [``config.json``](config_json) setting.

    They are allocated and used directly by [``main.cpp``](main_cpp).

## Interface

Each setup is required to expose several **``public``** member functions that the ``main.cpp`` uses to run a viable program session.
Examples:

- ``const cosmos& get_viewed_cosmos() const`` - return a reference to the [cosmos](cosmos) to be viewed in this frame.
- ``entity_id get_viewed_character_id() const`` - return an [id](entity_id) of the [entity](entity) that is used as the viewer in this frame.
- ``auto get_audiovisual_speed()`` const - get a floating-point scalar that determines the speed with which to advance all [audiovisual systems](audiovisual_system).
